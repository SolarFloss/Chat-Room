# Chat-Room
This is my very first project that I have an intent on finishing. 

This works by listening for changes in a .txt file that two clients share in a directory and adds that text to a text-area.

I made this with Java and JavaFX


I originally made this for a shared directory at my school. Now that I've graduated I have no need for it.



Using it is very simple.

1\. Create a screen name
2\. Browse for a text file that is in a directory that is shared with either the person you want to talk to or is shared with a group of people. <b> This is what makes the chat room work. If the file can't be seen by other people they will not be able to talk to you.</b>
3\. Click the Enter button and have a good time!
