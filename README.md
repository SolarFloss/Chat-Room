# Chat-Room
This is my very first project that I have an intent on finishing. 

This works by listening for changes in a .txt file that two clients share in a directory and adds that text to a text-area.

I made this with Java and JavaFX


I originally made this for a shared directory at my school. Now that I've graduated I have no need for it.



Using it is very simple.

1\. Create a screen name


2\. Choose a room on the list. If the list is empty create a new room by typing in a unique room name in the bar below the list and then clicking Create Room when you are satisfied. The name should pop up in the list.
  2a\. If you created a room you have to select it from the list to enter.



3\. Click the Enter button and have a good time!
